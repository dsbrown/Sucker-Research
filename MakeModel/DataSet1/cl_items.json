The car had no rust, rot or accidents, was a clean car, the build took place in San Diego at Jack Whites shop. Jack performed all the sheet metal work, paint work done to the car, the top was chopped four inches, the fenders, hood cut back six inches to make it more proportion. Then the head lights, tail lights, turn signals were frenched in, bumpers modified, hood pan caked, electric side mirrors, electric windows, hidden door hinges, electric doors, and trunk. The body was frame off, painted Ferrari red as was the suspension, interior was painted lexus charcoal gray, with gray leather and gray tweed, convertible top is Mercedes black. The inside of the car has vintage air, hand made rolled dash, cd stereo with amplifier in trunk, glide bucket seats, console, tilt stainless column, wool rugs. Suspension is original boxed in with mustang II power rack, rear is ford 9 inch with four bar and coil overs, stock gas tank, engine 350 Chevrolet, 350 turbo transmission, 4 wheel disc brakes, extra power cable hook up by right rear tire in case extra battery needed , main battery hidden in trunk. As you can tell in 1988,1989 there was no expense spared on this build, this merc has 33,000 miles on it, original paint, no cracks, chips, never washed with cold water, only luke warm water and has no clear coat. In 1989 at the Oakland roadster show the merc won the modified convertible class, June 1989, car cover, centerfold in Street Rodder, plus the car went on tour thru the US and won many more awards. The rims were made by Coddington , when you see other cars that say show quality, look at the under carriage, where the battery , brake boosters are located, see where the electrical wires, tubing are, what I am trying to say, even if this car is 27 years old it is a winner, ", "\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers", "\n", "\n", "\n\n    "], "v_fuel": ["gas"], "v_type": [], "price": ["$55000"], "map_link": ["https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@32.856200,-116.920100,16z"], "image_urls": ["http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_d9YPu3gamzE_600x450.jpg"], "map_accuracy": ["22"], "link": "http://seattle.craigslist.org//tac/cto/5623045674.html", "key": ["5623045674"], "address": [], "detail_title": ["1948 Mercury custom conveertible"], "condition": [], "cylinders": [], "transmission": ["automatic"], "VIN": [], "drive": [], "paint_color": [], "time": ["2016-06-26 19:25"]},

It is currently tuned on Crome Pro running E85 (the chip has a 2nd tune for pump gas on it if you wanted to run premium) and the last time on the dyno put down 430whp at 25 pounds of boost (could have gone for more hp but wanted a reliable daily driver).  I've owned a lot of high horse power Hondas/ Acuras and can honestly say this car is the fastest one I've owned.  The builder of this car did their homework choosing the parts in the build.  With the dual bb GT30 turbo the boost comes on fast and when Vtec kicks the car pulls very hard to redline.  The car was only ran once at the track and pulled a very respectable 11.5 sec in the quarter on drag radials, with a real set of slicks I would imagine you could get the car in the 10's.

Since I have had the car I replaced the following: radiator, all brakes and front rotors, alternator, rear leaf spring and bushings, all hoses and belts, water pump. All was done as preventative maintenance due age of car. Tires are 90%. This car runs and drives like new! Turn key, driver with clear title and plates. No cracks in fiberglass, original paint, no accidents (Nothing on Car-Fax).\u00a0This is one of the cleanest, never abused or modified, collectable and show worthy Corvette around. I will NOT call anyone or give out my phone number. Can show car any evening after 6 and on weekends. If interested reply via email and ask all your questions and to set an appointment to see the car.  Serious only. If you read to this point, it is still available. Serious, adult buyers with cash only.

Original owner - I bought this CRXsi brand new from Lynnwood Honda in December 1988.  My husband and I have been the only drivers - other than the two times is was stolen!  Stolen in 1992 during the Rodney King riots - recovered 4 days later with only missing side panel, windshield and tires - thieves left everything under the hood, seats, back window and all important things so it was not totaled, fixed up and we drove it for the next 24 years.  On January 11th this year was stolen again from the Renton Boeing parking garage.  Found two weeks later in Redmond, again left everything under the hood - only damage was the ignition column, gas flap door and thieves left windows open so rained inside.  In fixing the ignition column we had to go with 2 keys - one for door entry and one for starter so new owner has to keep two keys on ring.  The gas door does not completely shut but everything else cleaned up and ready for someone new.

So...  ...check out the pics to view the front end and passenger side fender damage.  The numbers matching 394 and automatic transmission were both very strong and I know this car will start up and drive, though currently the hood latch is mashed and haven't taken the time to free the hood, so dead battery.

The original window sticker was over $132,000, which was a staggering number for it's day. Mercedes' goal in the development of the 600 was to create a remarkable car that would compete with Rolls Royce head to head. The 600 was offered in a limited production and was Mercedes first production V12, offering 405 hp. This mammoth power plant is capable of launching this over 5,000 pound vehicle from rest to 60 in 5.7 seconds (not that I have ever done, or would do that, but its nice to know you can if you need to). This car has 67,000 documented miles, detailed and has never been in accident. Some of the unique features of 600SEL are the heated reclining rear seats and the double paned glass which creates an exceptionally quite interior cabin. The interior and exterior look and feel like new and will disappoint no one. I have all of the brochures and service history.

These generators allowed contractors to plug their power tools into a/c directly from their work truck (or campers to use in the middle of a field). ", "\nI bought this local Seattle truck from the original owner. It had not been started in a couple years. Cosmetically it looked like crap. There was Lots of rust in the bed. Almost nothing electrical was working. But, the body was extremely straight, low original mileage, the cab was completely dry with no funky smells, everything but the radio was there, it's the camper special, 390 engine, C6 transmission, 2 wheel drive, great potential with classic lines, a very collectable body style. So I bought it, changed the oil, put some Marvel Mystery oil in each spark plug hole to lubricate rings and cylinder walls, put in new spark plugs, drained old gas from both gas tanks, installed new fuel filter, pcv valve, air cleaner, checked points, installed news park plugs and started her up.", "\n It starts easily, does not smoke, runs through all gears smoothly ( just drove it to Warner Transmissions for a test ride and it shifts great through all gears, drives, and stops with no pulls (has disc brakes front/drum brakes rear. The title is free and clear and in my name. Known issues are: small rust hole bottom of driver and passenger door, needs new manifold gasket driver's side, tires hold air but are not safe for speed, needs new battery tray, oil dip stick holder needs to be securely installed. Original bench seat is very comfortable, the track works smoothly, and the original fabric seat has only one open seam. That's what I know so far. I have completely repaired truck bed with custom patch panels and bed coating. Rewired all tail, stop and side marker lights. New battery, starter solenoid, cleaned up old wiring from prior owner's addons, dealt with minor surface rust created by body side moldings, spent weeks cleaning original paint, repainted rear bumper,and about a million other things I've forgotten. The truck is bone stock original. I will continue working on this truck until it's sold, and the price will increase accordingly. The last thing I will do is get the ONAN generator to run. I have not made a serious to start it until I know for sure that it's serviced properly. All info is on line, and the local Cummins/ONAN service center is local Seattle ( if needed ). I have done my best to describe this gem accurately. It's 45 years old and needs to be serviced properly. $3500 cash only. No dickering on the price. No whining about hidden problems. I'm doing my best in describing all I know at this time. It's called a running project, not a new vehicle with a warranty. I can drive you around the neighborhood only.

Very few were sold in the US, and they were only sold as automatics here. This one has been heavily modified, correctly, by Midnight Motorsports in Seattle. From factory these diesels made 114hp, now making about 250hp. I have receipts dating back to 2008 on all work. All modifications were done in the last 30k however there is 226,xxx miles on the odometer. I've owned this car since January and have daily driven it since to school, work, and over the pass from Ellensburg to Issaquah without any issues. I've sat in stop and go traffic for hours, as well as cruised the highway at 80mph for hours, its happy to do whatever. Always well maintained, all fluids on the car were replaced with amsoil at 220k, belts done, battery is new, and tires are new. My financial situation has changed and I can no longer afford to keep such a valuable car. Its a charm to drive, gets looks and thumbs up everywhere, and don't plan on parking the car at the grocery store and not being stopped to answer questions.

This was the bad period in American car manufactures that they didn't use a good clear coat in the first place.  I have repainted the roof and hood the proper way by stripping them down to the bare metal, coated them with POR-15 rust preventative primer, and then matched the paint.  But otherwise, all you do is buff and polish to keep the paint from getting too bad.  2.  The AC clutch quit.  I did have it serviced and recharged with the proper R-12 coolant (which was hard to find a shop that still had it) about 5 years ago.  It worked great while I drove to LA.  When I got back to Seattle I didn't use the AC for a couple years.  When I turned it on the AC compressor clutch froze, so I pulled into an AutoZone, purchased a new Belt without the AC, and switched it there.  I never decided whether to convert the system to the new R-134a Coolant or replace the compressor clutch to keep using the expensive R-12 in it.

Also has bad transmission sensor which makes the traction control light stay on and also occasionally the service transmission light comes on.
